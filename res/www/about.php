<h3>jQuery form</h3>

Homepage: <a href="http://malsup.com/jquery/form/" target="_blank">http://malsup.com/jquery/form/</a>
<p>The jQuery Form plugin is dual licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malsup.github.com/mit-license.txt">MIT</a></li>
<li><a href="http://malsup.github.com/gpl-license-v2.txt">GPL</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You may use either license.  The MIT License is recommended for most projects because
 it is simple and easy to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can
  do with the plugin.</p>
<p>If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use the plugin under that license.</p>
<p>You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and you don't
 have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to use the jQuery Form
  Plugin in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is left intact.</p>
